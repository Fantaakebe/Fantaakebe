👋 Hi, I’m Fanta Kébé
About Me
I’m a second-year student at Northeastern University, pursuing a B.S. in Data Science and Psychology. I’m passionate about the intersection of both fields, particularly how technology can be used to promote mental health and well-being.

🌍 Background
I’m of West African descent, having grown up in both Conakry, Guinea and Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania. My experiences across different cultures have fueled my passion for learning and exploring new ideas.

Predictive Modeling: I love working on projects that involve predicting outcomes and making data-driven decisions.
Linguistics, English Writing & Etymology: I have a passion for language, its origins, and how it shapes our understanding of the world.
Aside from academics, I’m a huge fan of Football (Go Liverpool and FC Barcelona!), and I enjoy traveling, teaching, photography, and trying out new foods.

💻 Current Learning
I’m currently honing my skills in:

Machine Learning: Building models for predictive analytics.
Data Science Tools: Working with Python, R, and various data visualization libraries.
